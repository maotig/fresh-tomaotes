# [fresh-tomatoes](https://github.com/maotig/fresh-tomaotes)

Movie Trailer website

This is project 1 of udacity's full stack developer nanodegree program

The starting point for the generation code is here:
[fresh-tomatoes](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode)

The top level program is entertainment_center.py.

Run python entertainment_center.py, the application will generate
fresh_tomatoes.html with a list of my favorite movies and run a webbrowser
pointing to that page. 

The application can use the [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/) python module to add additional infomation
to each of the movie trailers from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).

To install the module run the following:

* pip install imdbpy

Note, to properly install you will need the development files for libxslt
install in your system if you are running linux.
